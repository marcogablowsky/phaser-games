    this.camera;	//	a reference to the game camera
    this.cache;		//	the game cache
    this.input;		//	the global input manager (you can access this.input.keyboard, this.input.mouse, as well from it)
    this.load;		//	for preloading assets
    this.math;		//	lots of useful common math operations
    this.sound;		//	the sound manager - add a sound, play one, set-up markers, etc
    this.stage;		//	the game stage
    this.time;		//	the clock
    this.tweens;	//	the tween manager
